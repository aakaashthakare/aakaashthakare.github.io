      <p>I'm Akash Thakare, a software developer with 3.7 years of experience in the industry. I graduated from the College of Engineering Pune with a Bachelor of Technology degree, where I gained a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering.
I began my career as a backend developer at OYO, where I was responsible for developing and maintaining various backend systems and APIs that powered the company's feedback and refund systems. During my time at OYO, I gained experience in working with distributed systems, databases, and APIs. Currently, I am working as a Software Development Engineer 2 at Veritas, where I contributed to various products within Data Compliance and Governance portfolio. Being a polyglot programmer, I am proficient in Java, C, C++, Golang. I love reading-books, driving cars, watching movies, and visiting new places. Overall, I am passionate about software development and enjoy the challenge of building scalable and robust backend systems that meet the needs of users. I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.</p>
